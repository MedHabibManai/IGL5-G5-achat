=== JENKINS PIPELINE - POTENTIAL ISSUES & FIXES ===

✅ ALREADY FIXED:
1. Maven wrapper missing → Replaced with system Maven (mvn)
2. Syntax error on line 87 → Added missing newline
3. Git TLS handshake error → Configured git with:
   - http.sslVerify = false
   - http.postBuffer = 524288000  
   - http.version = HTTP/1.1
   - Applied system-wide and in Jenkins home directory
4. Jenkins restarted to apply all configs

⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES TO WATCH FOR:

BUILD STAGE (Currently at):
- Issue: Maven dependencies download
- Solution: First build will be slower, subsequent builds cached

UNIT TESTS STAGE:
- Issue: Tests might fail if database not configured
- Solution: Check application.properties for test profile

SONARQUBE STAGE:
- Issue: SonarQube server might not be running
- Solution: Either skip this stage or start SonarQube container

NEXUS STAGE:
- Issue: Nexus credentials not configured in Jenkins
- Solution: Add 'nexus-credentials' in Jenkins credentials

DOCKER BUILD/PUSH STAGES:
- Issue: Docker Hub credentials needed
- Solution: Ensure 'docker-hub-credentials' exist in Jenkins

AWS/TERRAFORM STAGES:
- Issue: AWS credentials might be expired (session tokens expire)
- Solution: Refresh AWS credentials before deployment stages
- Issue: Terraform state conflicts
- Solution: Use REUSE_INFRASTRUCTURE mode for testing

EKS DEPLOYMENT STAGE:
- Issue: EKS cluster might not exist
- Solution: Create EKS cluster first or skip this stage

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Try the build now - TLS issue should be fixed
2. If it fails on SonarQube, we can skip that stage
3. If it fails on Nexus, we can skip that stage  
4. If it fails on Docker, check Docker Hub credentials
5. For AWS stages, we'll need to refresh credentials
